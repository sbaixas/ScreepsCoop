# ScreepsCoop

## Rules of engagement:

* Use PR to get pushes to master, this is a cooperative effort.
* Reviews are to be taken seriously, dont just approve, give feedback and see how it can be better.
* Some improvements might be out of scope, make a new ticket, dont hold the PR hostage.
* Check naming, code quality, function and efficiency intoa ccount.
* Commit only whats related to the change, you dont want to have to read 20 files and 100 lines per file of changes when only 1 is relevant to the change you want to make.
* If possible build from develop and always rebase before PR, but if you want to make changes that compound into each other and the reviewer is lagging you can probably make features start from your other feature ( as they get bigger they will be harder to review).

## Tickets

[trello](https://trello.com/b/ipKtDksw/screeps)

* Create tickets in **new** when they are in the idea stage.
* Move them to  **approved** when you are sure they should be implemented, and the way of implementing it is clear.
* Pick tickets from approved to start working on them and move them to **Doing**.
* Move them to **Review** when you think they are done (alternatively you can create a draft review if you want some review done before its finished)
* issues go to Done when they are merged into master

## Comunication

Join discord .. tickets are good for communication, but talking issues out is better.
